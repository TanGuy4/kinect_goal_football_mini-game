### Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `test`: the folder to maintain unit and functionnal tests

When you compile there is a `bin` directory created.

And Create a `lib` directory in which you add dependecies (see below).

### Commands Files

- `compile` for compiling, place dependencies in a folder call `lib` before.
- `run` for running the mini-game, place the dependencies in a folder call `lib` before.

- NITE PrimeSense (filename: com.primesense.NITE.jar)
- JUnit v4.13.1 (For Unit Tests Only) (filename: junit-4.13.1.jar)
